## Context

This project was done in 24 hours as part of a one-day hackatron, 
organized by School of Applied Technology, aka SALT. ðŸ§‚ 

## Idea

Motivated by my failure to remember my friends' birthdays 
I created a simple application that could do this for me.

## Running the solution

1. You need to create a local database on your SQL server. Name it however you like, 
but make sure to adapt the connection string at appsettings.json
2. Update the database with 'dotnet ef database update'
2. Run the .Net project with 'dotnet watch run'
3. Run the React project with 'npm start'

## Tech stack

.Net Web API,
React with Javascript,
SQL Sever
Docker

## Future

Future improvements might include adding the following:
- user accounts and authentication
- a field for things a friend likes (will help when choosing a gift - better than socks!)
- desktop-friendliness
- notifications
- option to edit
